# Project Title

## Introduction

The project focuses on applying machine learning (ML) techniques to tackle a predictive task. Various ML algorithms will be explored, including those covered in class or others. The choice of algorithms and datasets will be left to the discretion of the user.

## Dataset

The project offers the following datasets for analysis:

1. **Bank Marketing Dataset**: This dataset pertains to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The objective is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)

There are four datasets: 
1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]
2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from the previous one, and 20 inputs.
3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 
4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs). 
The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g., SVM). 

2. **Student Dropout and Academic Success Dataset**: Derived from multiple disjoint databases from a higher education institution, this dataset focuses on students enrolled in various undergraduate degrees. The task involves predicting students' dropout rates and academic success. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success)

3. **Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Dataset**: This dataset contains hourly counts of public bicycles rented in the Seoul Bike Sharing System, along with corresponding weather data and holiday information. The goal is to predict the number of rented bikes on specific days. [Dataset Link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand)
