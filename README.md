# Project Title

## Introduction

In an increasingly competitive financial landscape, banks continually seek innovative strategies to enhance customer engagement and increase profitability. One effective approach involves predicting customer behavior to tailor marketing strategies more accurately. This report focuses on the use of machine learning to predict whether clients of a Portuguese banking institution will subscribe to a term deposit. The prediction is based on data gathered from direct marketing campaigns, primarily phone calls. By applying machine learning techniques, the bank aims to improve the effectiveness of its marketing campaigns, thus potentially increasing the subscription rates of its term deposits. The insights gained could significantly influence the bank's decision-making processes and allocation of marketing resources.

# Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is known as the "Bank Marketing Dataset." It comprises data collected from direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese bank, conducted via telephone calls. The dataset spans from May 2008 to November 2010 and is categorized into four subsets, of which the most comprehensive set, `bank-additional-full.csv`, is utilized for this study. This subset contains 41,188 examples and 20 input features that describe client demographics, campaign details, and previous interactions.

Key features include:
- **Client data**: Age, job type, marital status, education, credit default, average yearly balance, housing, and personal loans.
- **Campaign data**: Contact type, last contact day and month, duration, number of contacts in the campaign, days since the last contact, and previous campaign outcomes.

The target variable, `y`, indicates if the client subscribed to a term deposit, making this a binary classification task. Each feature's role is critical as it provides insights that could predict customer behavior towards term deposit subscriptions effectively. By analyzing these features, the study seeks to build a predictive model that could assist the bank in optimizing its marketing strategies for better customer engagement and profitability.
## Goal of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit, as indicated by the binary variable `y`. This classification goal is pivotal for the bank as it seeks to refine its marketing approaches and effectively allocate resources towards clients most likely to convert. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to analyze historical data from previous marketing campaigns, the project aims to enhance the precision of predictions concerning client responses. This targeted approach not only promises to elevate the efficiency of future campaigns but also potentially boosts the bank’s overall success in securing term deposit subscriptions. The outcome of this project is expected to provide actionable insights that could lead to more personalized and successful client interactions, thereby driving up subscription rates and improving customer satisfaction.

# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this project, our objective is to meticulously prepare and analyze the dataset for predicting client subscription to term deposits at a Portuguese bank, drawing from direct marketing campaign data.

## Data Cleaning

The foundation of a successful analysis in data science starts with thorough data cleaning. For our dataset consisting of 45,211 records and 17 attributes, initial inspections revealed a well-compiled data set with no missing values across the board, which is relatively rare in real-world data scenarios. However, the 'pdays' attribute, indicating days since the last contact from a previous campaign, mostly registered as '-1', denoting no prior contact. Given that over 80% of the 'pdays' entries were '-1', this attribute was removed to streamline the dataset and focus on more impactful variables.

The dataset's integrity was further refined by addressing 'unknown' entries in significant categorical variables such as 'job', 'education', 'contact', and 'poutcome'. Each 'unknown' entry potentially dilutes the predictive strength of our models. For 'education' and 'job', where 'unknown' statuses were comparatively low, these entries were removed to preserve the robustness of those categories. For 'poutcome' and 'contact', which had a high proportion of 'unknowns', the entire attributes were dropped to avoid skewing our analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Post-cleaning, we delved into the Exploratory Data Analysis to unearth any underlying patterns or insights that could aid in building robust predictive models. 

**Target Variable Analysis:**
The target variable 'y', which indicates whether a client subscribes to a term deposit, was significantly skewed. With around 88.3% of clients not subscribing, the data exhibited a pronounced imbalance that could potentially bias predictive modeling towards the majority class. This aspect called for specialized techniques in handling imbalanced data to ensure both classes are predicted with high accuracy.

**Categorical Variable Insights:**
Exploration of categorical variables revealed distinct trends; for instance, clients with management jobs or a tertiary education level showed a slightly higher propensity for subscribing to term deposits. Conversely, those with blue-collar jobs or basic education were less likely to subscribe. The month of contact also seemed to play a role, with months like May experiencing higher contact rates but not necessarily higher subscription rates, suggesting a possible fatigue effect.

**Numerical Data Distribution:**
Numerical attributes such as age, balance, and call duration were analyzed for distribution patterns. The age and balance variables were right-skewed, indicating that a majority of clients were younger and with lower yearly balances. The call duration showed a wide range with a peak in shorter calls, hinting that shorter, possibly more efficient calls could be more frequent but not necessarily more effective in achieving subscriptions.

**Correlation Study:**
The correlation matrix analysis among numerical attributes offered modest insights, with no variables showing strong predictive correlations with the target. However, subtle interactions, such as between campaign (number of contacts during the campaign) and other variables like age or balance, suggested more nuanced relationships that could be modeled.

**Graphical Representations:**
Visual examinations further supported these findings, showcasing the distribution imbalances and highlighting potential areas of focus for modeling strategies. For instance, the stark contrast in subscription rates across different job categories and education levels in bar graphs helped in identifying demographic segments that are more likely to respond positively to the term deposit offerings.

In summary, the data cleaning and exploratory analysis phases not only prepared our dataset for advanced analytical modeling but also highlighted critical trends and patterns. These insights are pivotal for developing targeted strategies that enhance the predictive accuracy and effectiveness of the bank’s marketing campaigns, ultimately leading to better client engagement and increased profitability.

# Pre-processing and Feature Engineering

The effectiveness of a predictive model in machine learning significantly depends on the quality of pre-processing and feature engineering. In this project, we focus on ensuring our data is optimally prepared for modeling, which includes handling various types of data and standardizing measurements.

## Pre-processing Data

Initial investigations into the dataset's structure revealed eight nominal features without any ordinal or continuous attributes, pointing to a dataset predominantly categorical in nature. These features include job type, marital status, education level, default history, housing and personal loan status, the month of last contact, and the target variable y (subscription outcome). The absence of ordinal features simplifies our approach, allowing us to primarily focus on one-hot encoding to transform these nominal variables for better analysis and prediction.

One-hot encoding was applied to convert categorical variables into a format that could be more easily interpreted by machine learning algorithms. This process involves creating new binary columns for each category of a nominal variable, which indicates the presence (1) or absence (0) of each possible value in the original data record. This method is particularly useful for handling non-numeric data and maintaining the independence of categories, a crucial aspect for many classification algorithms.

## Feature Engineering

A critical step in feature engineering was the analysis of feature correlations to identify any redundant pairs of features that might lead to multicollinearity, where highly correlated features can distort the importance of variables in some models. Our correlation analysis revealed several pairs of binary variables created from one-hot encoding that were perfectly correlated with each other, such as 'loan_yes' and 'loan_no'. Additionally, some features like 'marital_married' and 'marital_single' showed a significant correlation, suggesting an overlap in the information they provide.

Based on the correlation threshold of 0.7, we identified and removed features that were redundant, thereby simplifying the model's complexity without sacrificing predictive power. This step helps in reducing overfitting and improves the generalization of the model on unseen data.

### Scaling Numerical Features

To further refine our model, numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler, a common preprocessing technique that standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. This technique transforms the data such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1, ensuring that each feature contributes equally to the distance computations in the model, an essential aspect especially for distance-based algorithms like KNN.

By standardizing the data, we not only improve the convergence during training but also enhance the model's performance by treating all features equally, thus preventing any single feature with a higher range from dominating the predictive process.

In summary, our pre-processing and feature engineering steps have prepared a robust dataset ready for the subsequent phases of model training and evaluation. This foundation is crucial for developing reliable predictive models that can effectively support the bank's marketing strategies by identifying potential subscribers to term deposits.

# Model Training and Evaluation

This section of the report delineates the comprehensive approach adopted for model training, selection, and evaluation. The methodology ensures rigorous validation and testing to assess the predictive performance and robustness of the models developed.

## Data Splitting

The dataset was meticulously divided into three distinct sets: training, validation, and test. This separation facilitates an unbiased evaluation of the models, ensuring that they are trained on one subset of the data and validated and tested on completely independent subsets. Specifically, 80% of the data was used for training, with the remaining 20% for testing. Further, 20% of the training set was reserved for validation purposes. This structured approach aids in mitigating overfitting and validating the model’s effectiveness before final testing.

## Model Training and Selection

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
The KNN algorithm was implemented with initial hyperparameters set at three neighbors and uniform weights. The model's performance was assessed using the F1 score, a critical metric given the dataset's imbalance. The validation F1 score and accuracy were calculated to ensure the model's capability to generalize beyond the training data.

#### Hyperparameter Tuning
A grid search was conducted over a range of neighbors and weight options to fine-tune the KNN model. This process was instrumental in identifying the optimal settings that maximize validation accuracy, thereby enhancing the model's performance.

### Random Forest
Random Forest was employed due to its efficacy in handling large datasets and capability to model non-linear relationships. The model was initially configured with 100 trees. Subsequent tuning involved adjusting the number of trees and the maximum depth to strike a balance between learning detailed data patterns and avoiding overfitting.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes
As a probabilistic classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes was chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling binary classification tasks. It was evaluated based on its accuracy and F1 score on the test set to confirm its predictive power and reliability.

## Model Evaluation

### Validation and Test Results
Each model was rigorously evaluated on both validation and test datasets. Performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score were computed to assess each model's effectiveness in correctly predicting the outcomes. These metrics are crucial for understanding the models' strengths and weaknesses in practical scenarios.

### Analysis of Overfitting
The training and validation accuracies were particularly monitored to detect any signs of overfitting. Models exhibiting high training accuracy but lower validation accuracy were scrutinized for potential overfitting issues.

### Confusion Matrix Analysis
Confusion matrices were generated for each model to visualize the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This analysis is vital for understanding the models' performance in predicting each class, especially in an imbalanced dataset where the minority class prediction is often more challenging.

## Insights and Recommendations

The evaluation process highlighted that while some models like Random Forest showed promising accuracy, they also indicated potential overfitting as evidenced by the discrepancies between training and validation performances. The KNN model, after hyperparameter tuning, and Gaussian Naive Bayes provided baseline comparisons but required further adjustments to enhance their predictive accuracies and F1 scores.

### Conclusion

The detailed training and evaluation process underscore the complexity and challenges in developing predictive models for marketing data. Random Forest, with its balance between accuracy and F1 score, emerged as the most effective model post-tuning. However, continual refinement and exploration of additional models or ensemble methods are recommended to further improve the predictions and handle the dataset's inherent imbalances more effectively. This iterative approach to model building and evaluation ensures that the developed models not only achieve high accuracy but are also robust and reliable in various operational scenarios.
